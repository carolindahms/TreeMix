# TreeMix
Scripts to infer population aplits and mixture events from alelle frequency data using TreeMix by Pickrell & Pritchard (2012). This pipeline runs TreeMix with bootstrapping, helps choose number of migration events and creates a consensus tree. It plots the maximum likelihood tree with bootstrap values, drift and residuals and calculates statistics for every migration event, such as migration support, standard error and p-values.
